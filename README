BUILDING

* Cmockery

	Cmockery (http://code.google.com/p/cmockery/) has to be installed
	(headers & lib) in order to build the native part.

	Remember to add Cmockery lib path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

	TEMPORARY: You also have to invoke sh/mock-symlinks.sh from code dir before building.

* Native code coverage reports with lcov

	lcov (http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) has to be installed
	in order to generate coverage reports.

	Also, location of coverage-lcov.sh (see code/sh/coverage-lcov.sh)
	has to be added to PATH and execution permissions for coverage-lcov.sh
	have to be set.

	Native code coverage reports are enabled in `coverage' profile
	(mvn -P coverage ...).

* Maven

	Invoke mvn inside xbow dir to build the source.
